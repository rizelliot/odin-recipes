    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lean steak</strong> – Start with a very good lean steak, like
        sirloin, beef tenderloin, or top round beef. Ask your butcher for a
        fresh steak and tell them you’ll be eating it raw.
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Capers</strong> – These add a nice acidity to help balance out
        the flavors.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <strong>Cornichons</strong> – Or small dill pickles. Just don’t use
        sweet pickles.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <strong>Shallots</strong> – To give each bite a subtle savory flavor.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong> – A classic choice in most beef
        tartare recipes. Its bold umami flavors play well with the acidity in
        each bite.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Parsley</strong> – Fresh is best!</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg yolks</strong> – To serve on top of the beef tartare or to
        mix in with the meat. Make sure you use fresh eggs and keep them
        refrigerated up until it’s time to serve.
      </li>
    </ul>
